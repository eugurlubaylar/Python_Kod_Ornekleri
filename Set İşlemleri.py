# Program to perform different set operations like in mathematics

# define two sets
e = {0, 2, 4, 6, 8};
n = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};

# set union
print("Union of E and N is", e | n)

# set intersection
print("Intersection of E and N is", e & n)

# set difference
print("Difference of E and N is", e - n)

# set symetric difference
print("Symmetric difference of E and N is", e ^ n)
